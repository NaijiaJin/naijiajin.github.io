  I am a programmer and technical artist. I always want to express my ideas in the most modern, immersive 
  and aesthetically appealing way. Now I am a candidate for Master of Entertainment Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. 
  It is part of my natural talent to integrate art and technology for design and expression.
