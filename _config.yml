  I am now a candidate for Master of Entertainment Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. 
  I am a programmer and technical artist. I always want to express my ideas in the most modern, immersive 
  and aesthetically appealing way. 
  It is also part of my natural talent to integrate art and technology for design and expression using computers.  
  Following an interdisciplinary curriculum in Digital Media Technology during undergraduate study, 
  I have built a broad foundation of knowledge and gained practical experience not only in VR, AR, 
  computer graphics, animation technology, and 3D modelings, 
  but also developed strong programming skills in C#, C++, and Python.
