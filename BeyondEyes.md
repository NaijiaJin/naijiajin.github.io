## Round 1 

### Project description:
Our design and development goal in this round is to build a virtual worlds that let guests help character A who's fear of character B. We created a story about helping a little girl overcome the fear of being bullied. The gameplay is guests need to burn out those creepy hands in her nightmire. The creepy hands reprensents viciousness that hurted the little girl. 

### My contribution:

Torch fire effect with unity particle system
